  # Fix Business Settings RLS Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Add policy for authenticated users to manage business settings
    - Ensure proper tenant context handling
    - Add fallback policy for system operations

  2. Changes
    - Update existing policies to be more permissive for authenticated users
    - Add policy for creating initial business settings
    - Ensure tenant_id can be null for single-tenant setups
*/

-- Drop existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anonymous can read business settings" ON business_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Tenant admins can manage their business settings" ON business_settings;

-- Create more permissive policies for business settings
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can read business settings"
  ON business_settings
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage business settings"
  ON business_settings
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Ensure the table allows null tenant_id for single-tenant setups
ALTER TABLE business_settings ALTER COLUMN tenant_id DROP NOT NULL;
